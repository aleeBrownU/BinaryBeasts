% Basket cells = inhibitory cells
% Pyramidal cells = excitatory cells


Create array for each pyrmidal cell's ID (170 to 269)
Create array for each basket cells's ID (135 TO 169)

Use a for loop for the pyrmidal cells:
  Define the current cell --> so we know what cell we're on
  Find each spike for the given cell 
  Calculate ISI
 
Use a for loop for the basket cells:
  Define the current cell --> so we know what cell we're on
  Find each spike for the given cell 
  Calculate ISI
  
Calculate mean ISI for basket cells and for the pyrmidal cells
