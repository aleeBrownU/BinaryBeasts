Ask user for the number of cell IDs per sample
  Generate a vector of randomized distribution of Cell IDs
    Compute the ISI for the given cell IDs
  Calculate mean and standard deviation for the given sample
  
Repeat above for number given by user to give simulated distribution (bootstrapping)

Perform statistical tests for comparison between the simulated distributions of each Gamma
