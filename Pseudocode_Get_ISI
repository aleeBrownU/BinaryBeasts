% Basket cells = inhibitory cells
% Pyramidal cells = excitatory cells

Define array that will go through all 12 datasets (ex. data_set = 1:12)

Retrieve input file (files 1 through 12) and run through rest of the code for each file


Create array for each pyrmidal cell's ID (170 to 269)
Create array for each basket cells's ID (135 TO 169)

Use a for loop for the pyrmidal cells:
  Define the current cell --> so we know what cell we're on
  Find each spike for the given cell 
  Calculate ISI
  Assign the ISI to "mean matrix" that we'll use later to average the all of the ISI's of all the cells

Calculate mean ISI for basket cells and for the pyrmidal cells from the vector=1/frequency
