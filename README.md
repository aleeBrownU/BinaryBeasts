# BinaryBeasts
Group Project 1 for CLPS 0950

To run, Run the Analysis.m program on Matlab. Datasets in "Gamma#.txt" files need to be downloaded as well.


Overall hours and Work designations:*
Kush: Collect data from HNN(5 hrs), Overall pseudocode (5 hrs), Pseudocode and overall program section for analyzing HNN data and figure 1(8 hrs), Assist in tasks of other team members (5 hrs) , Work on demo (2 hrs) 
Adrian: Overall pseudocode (5 hrs), Github management and compilation of segments of code (3 hrs), Pseudocode and overall program section for Figures 2 and 3 (10 hrs), Assist in tasks of other team members (5 hrs) , Work on demo (2 hrs)
Jack: Overall pseudocode (5 hrs), Bug fixing (3 hrs), Pseudocode and overall program section for Figure 4 and bootstrapping analysis (10 hrs), Assist in tasks of other team members (5 hrs), Work on demo (2 hrs)

*Since everything is run on a single program (Analysis.m) and we found issues with pushing and pulling at the same time after editing the file, we figured it was easiest to transfer code to Adrian within our Gathertown hours to push to Github on a single computer. We did not realize we could not change contributions for different commits after the fact.
